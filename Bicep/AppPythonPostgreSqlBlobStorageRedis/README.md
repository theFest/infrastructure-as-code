## Running the bicep code

You can run the bicep code directly with the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/nubesgen-install-az-cli).
Make sure to have an up to date version - bicep support may not be present on older versions - and authenticate using `az login`.

You can deploy your infrastructure with the following command. Please replace `{environment}` by the name of your environment.

```shell
az deployment sub create --name 'demo-7658-7723{environment}' --location westeurope --template-file main.bicep
```
